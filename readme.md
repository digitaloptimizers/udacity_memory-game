# Synopsis

This project is made for the Udacity Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program.

The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.

The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.


## Motivation

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating my mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've build a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration).

## Installation

Download all the files and put them in a folder on your computer (or website).
Open the index.html with your browser to start playing the game, or go to your url (e.g. www.yourdomainname.com/game/index.hmtl) to start the game (and share it with friends).

Note:
This game has dependencies with Jquery and Jquery UI.
You can point the files below to the current CDN (Google.com and Jquery.com) or download these libraries and install them in your /js/-folder to run the game independent from the internet.

///// DEPENDENCIES /////
* jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js
* 1.12.1/jquery-ui.js

## Tests

Simple run the index.html with the additional css & js-files to star the game.
You can download this game and use it on your personal website.
